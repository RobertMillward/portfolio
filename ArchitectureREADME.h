/**
 * Using Java nomenclature, this set of demo code has both Classes and Instances.
 * Within those are api (functions) and data. They frequently exist independently but can be
 * packaged.
 * There are four major divisions or silos in the code: application (meaning person, lineItem, etc),
 * quality assurance,  helpers, and service designated by A, Q, H, and S respectivly. Service
 * functions are never execution traced whereas the others may be.
 * Class related structure names have a "C" after the silo code. Instance related structure names
 * have an "I" there. Application structure names have an "A" near the end.
 * Further, to keep code files small, levels have been implemented. Level "0" is at the very
 * bottom. Level "8" is currently the top. The higher the level the higher the complexity or
 * interaction with other levels.
 * Further, to simplify versions and inheritance a version letter has been implemented
 * for api's.The version letter starts at "O" and works toward "A". The letter "Z" is the data level
 * that can support all api versions.
 * Finally, the test data generators have "T" through "P" near the end of the name and
 * "Y" is the root.
 * Code is further separated into "api" and "data" with "this" being both.
 * So from this, the purpose of the various file names might be easy to deduce:
 * - PersonO0AIapi would be level O, version 0 application instance function pointers
 * - PersonO0AIdata would be an instance data structure
 * - PersonO0AIthis would be the combined api and data structures with a pointer to
 * the api if size is an issue or including the api structure if not. Thus:
 * - PersonO0AIthisT myPerson = PersonO0ACapi.new(...);
 * - PersonO0AIdataT myPersonData = PersonO0ACapiP->newData(...);
 * - are two ways to instantiate Person data with one also giving the api.
 * - As can be seen, each structure type ends in "T".
 * - If a pointer is being used then it has a "P" before the "T" as myPersonZ0ACDataPT.
 * - Additionally, a newThis() or newData() is a function of the class.
 *
 * One last example set:
 * - PersonO0QIdata is a Quality Instance
 * - TimeSerNbrO0HCapi.getIt(...) is a Helper structure function call
 * - TimeSerNbrZ0HCapiT and TimeSerNbrZ0HCdataT is root data and functions.
 *
 * FInally, many header files end with Plan.h and these are how the data is defined
 * and contain the definitions that the code is built around. There can be a function structure
 * at the end of a "Z0" which exposes some of the internal information as a testing hook.
 * Those functions and data are, as they say, subject to change without notice.
