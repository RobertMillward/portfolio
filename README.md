# portfolio

This is the portfolio of my personal library. The code is straight C. You see the function header files and test files here.

You see a sample of my quality of work.

This library is for instruction and entertainment purposes and promotion of my skills. 

No presumption of the suitability of the code for anything but instruction and entertainment is to surmised.

There is much code behind these portfolio files. The code is in a private repository. The code and the data header files are available at a modest cost. Mentoring is slso available. 

I am also willing to code to your specification and to do design reviews as well as build automated testing.
